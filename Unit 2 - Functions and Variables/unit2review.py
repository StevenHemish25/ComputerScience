print()
input()  # 2 basic functions, You know something is a function because it has () at the end, what goes in the () are called parameters
#parameters are information that the function needs to run, I say jump, you say how high? How high is the parameter.
print("hello world!") #Hello world is the parameter
input(" what isi your favorite animal?\n>") #\n is called an escape character (linebreak)
#input is never required, it is a special thing, not required unless asked for input

#variables
#Variables are a way to store data for later use in the program.
#syntax = grammar
#<name> = <value>  
x = 5        # x is the variable namme, 5 is the value.
#snake_case naming convention - all_lowercase_underscores_for_spaces. 
#CONCISE: Short and descriptive
username = "osowski" #string,          #Define string of characters
fav_animal = "Calugo"                  #define string
total_poptarts = 12 #integer        define integer (whole numbers)
percent_complete = 23.52 #float      define float (decimal numbers)
is_cool = True # boolean     define boolean   (true false values)
first_letter = 'c' # Character  define character, use single quotes usually for characters  (single keyboard symbol)

total_poptarts = 8           #reassigning variable, already exists, changing value


# Arithmetic operators (sounds scary but is just basic math)
# + , - , *, / , ** , %, //,
print(2 + 2)           #4
print("2" + "2")       #22
print("cat" + "dog")   #catdog
print("cat" * 3)  #catcatcat
print("cat" + 3)  #ERROR, cant use + for string and int


my_variable = 2 + 3  #arithmetic operations can be done anywhere
