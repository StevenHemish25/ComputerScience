#String functions
# String functions are a group of functions that modify string, they manipulate them
# .lower()

x = "Lord of the Rings"
x = x.lower()

print(x)  #.lower changes the string to be all lowercase.
#.lower() can be used to accept answers that have capitalization errors, it will accept all answers despite capitilization
#.lower can be used after any string

x = "Lord of the Rings".lower()

#.capitalize() changes the entire string to lowercase, then capitalizes the first letter
# "Hello World!" > "Hello world!"



#.title() changes the entire string to titlecase
# "hello world!" > "Hello World!" 
#titlecase is like treating something like a proper noun


#.swapcase() invertss the capitalization of every character.
# "Hello World!" > "hELLO wORLD!"


#TEST: I have a string, what would happen to it if I used .title
